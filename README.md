# Demo Case Management Application

Familiarising myself with the Github. SO far everything looks new, I am excitied to get to know my way around.
Hopefully my first project could be a case management application, which helps laywers organise and stay abreast with their cases. 
Additional features such as a case specific precent library (be it templates of applications or statuory or case law references will be added soon).
